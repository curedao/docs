# 🎨 CureDAO Brand Guide Challenge

#### Concept Vote Results

### Project Overview

CureDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) of scientists, governments, businesses, and nonprofits devoted to the minimization of suffering. To achieve this, we propose the creation of an open-source framework that overcomes the traditional economic & time barriers in the field of digital health.

Ultimately, our vision is the realization of global artificial intelligence that will aggregate and analyze data from every human being. It will then use this to provide personalized guidance on alleviating and preventing chronic diseases.

It is important to solidify our brand image to communicate this mission and inspire the participation of all humans.

The CureDAO brand will continue to be optimized through experimentation and the collection of marketing data.

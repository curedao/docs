We're looking for a Product Designer to join the team at CureDAO. Interested in designing a product that helps the world? Then read on…

ABOUT YOU
You're a maker. 
Most of what you'll do on a daily basis is designing, mocking, prototyping, testing, and iterating on the core CureDAO product. 
CureDAO has an enormous world-changing mission to eradicate mental illness in the same way that polio was once eradicated. 
Since this challenge is so great, we need the brightest minds in the world to help us realize this goal.

You design in HTML and CSS, and you're not afraid of JS. You'll be committing your work alongside engineers in our main codebase.

You design for the web. Your design is modern and clean. 
You've built functional web apps before and understand the ramifications of web-app trends. 
You spend less time in Sketch than you do in your code editor and browser. 
You probably spend an equal amount of time with Chrome Dev Tools open as you do closed.

You're a master at handling complexity. 
Behind the scenes, CureDAO is a technical beast, but you thrive at delivering a joyful, easy-to-use experience to each customer so they can succeed at using the product. 
CureDAO is probably the hardest product you'll ever work on.

Your design process might include wireframing, low-fidelity mocking, high-fidelity mocking, and plenty of user testing along the way. 
You don't "toss designs over the wall" rather you work closely with engineers to implement your own designs.

You can prioritize the 5 projects on your plate. There's no shortage of things you could be doing at CureDAO. 
But you're a pro at prioritizing your work. 
You're comfortable communicating and when something is blocking you, you aren't shy about reaching out to fellow teammates to get back up and running as quickly as possible.

You love working with customers (and teammates) to help understand their needs and generate a product spec. 
You can help turn that spec into reality.

You love doing things efficiently. At CureDAO, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. 
We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.

You love to set your own course with our shared set of goals. At CureDAO, you'll have a weekly project meeting, daily scrum meetings, and then you go make things happen. 
You default to action.

THINGS YOU MIGHT DO
CureDAO is a startup, so you'll likely get your hands dirty in a little bit of everything. That said, here are some things you'll do:
Design, mock, prototype, test, and iterate on CureDAO's main user-facing product
Get your hands dirty implementing your designs in HTML, CSS, and some JS
Ship to hundreds of thousands of active users every day
Help conduct A/B tests and other experiments
Work and ship product independently
Give back to the community via open source and blog posts
Help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible
Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change

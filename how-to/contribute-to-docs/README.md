### Editing Directly on GitHub

**(recommended for beginners or small changes)**

Once logged in, you'll be taken to the GitHub built-in text editor where you can make your edits directly. When you've completed your changes, you can add any specific details on what was changed create a new Pull Request to the repository. From there one of the maintainers will review your changes, and either merge them or request changes.

Remember that after you click "Propose Changes", you must also click on "Create Pull Request" on the next page.

The process is illustrated in this [visual walk-through](https://scribehow.com/shared/How\_to\_Write\_a\_Constitution\_In\_a\_Democratic\_Fashion\_\_XPpT\_GzCQC27ouEjEF2oXg).

2. Please adhere to the guidelines in the [Writing Style Guide](style-guide.md).
3. **Commit messages should be as detailed as possible to describe the changes made.**

CureDAO is open to anyone interested in preventing suffering and death from chronic diseases and degenerative diseases. Our success in this mission will be an exponential function of the participation of people like you. 🚀

Creating a new ecosystem for health data not only requires developers, but anyone with skills in:

* User interface and user experience design
* Project management
* Communications and marketing
* Web3 technologies
* Business development
* Life sciences
* Medicine
* Data science

Our main philosophy is: It's not what you CAN do, but what do you WANT to do is what counts.

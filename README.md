# 💡 Litepaper

## tl;dr

We are creating an open-source framework that overcomes the traditional economic barriers to cooperation and data-sharing in digital health.

It consists of two primary components:

1. An Open-Source Platform for Health Data:
   1. Storage
   2. Security
   3. Access Control
   4. De-identified Data Sharing
2. A Plugin Framework enabling anyone to create or use plugins that facilitate:
   1. Data from any data source
   2. New Clinical Discoveries through machine learning
   3. Personalized Real-Time Decision Suggestions to most effectively treat and prevent diseases
   4. Data Format Transformation to enable interoperability with any system or application
   5. Patient Management
   6. Decentralized Clinical Trial Management
   7. Precision Medicine
   8. Large-scale, low-cost research to discover new ways to prevent and treat diseases

![The Platform](assets/diagrams/layered-platform-architecture-diagram.png)

It overcomes the traditional barriers of collaboration and data sharing by encoding contributions through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Using smart contracts, the platform will compensate all contributors with royalties.

## 💡 Litepaper

### :skull\_crossbones: Problem: You and Everyone You Love Will Suffer and Die

Over [2 billion](https://www.george-health.com/global-health-challenge/) people are suffering and [150,000](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/how-many-people-die-each-day-covid-19-coronavirus/) people die every single day from preventable diseases. For perspective, this is equivalent to:

* [**FIFTY-ONE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\_of\_the\_September\_11\_attacks) September 11th attacks every day
* [**NINE**](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/6-million-where-is-the-figure-from-1.10570907) Holocausts every year

### 💡 Solution: A Collaborative Framework for Personalized, Precision Health

The solution is to use the oceans of real-world evidence to accelerate the discovery of new cures and reveal hidden causes of disease.

The human body can be viewed as a black box with inputs (like diet, treatments, etc) and outputs (like symptom severity).  We're creating a mathematical model of human biology to determine the input factors and values that produce optimal health outcomes.

![Machine Learning Health Optimization Protocol](assets/analytics/black-box-model-animation.gif)

#### The Potential of Evidence-Based Studies

* **Diagnostics** - Data mining and analysis to identify causes of illness
* **Preventative medicine** - Predictive analytics and data analysis of genetic, lifestyle, and social circumstances to prevent disease
* **Precision medicine** - Leveraging aggregate data to drive hyper-personalized care
* **Medical research** - Data-driven medical and pharmacological research to discover new treatments and medicines
* **Reduction of adverse medication events** - Harnessing big data to spot medication errors and flag potential adverse reactions
* **Cost reduction** - Driving better patient outcomes for long-term savings
* **Population health** - Identify health strategies based on demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic trends

### Why Clinical Research Has Failed

It takes over [10 years and $2.6 billion](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Innovation-in-the-pharmaceutical-industry%3A-New-of-DiMasiGrabowski/3275f31c072ac11c6ca7a5260bd535720f07df41) to bring a drug to market (including failed attempts). It costs [$41k](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/getting-a-handle-on-clinical-trial-costs-0001#:\~:text=The%20clinical%20trials%20cost%20a,and%20benchmarking%20clinical%20trial%20costs.) per subject in Phase III clinical trials.&#x20;

The high costs lead to:

**1. No Data on Unpatentable Molecules**

We still know next to nothing about the long-term effects of 99.9% of the 4 pounds of over [7,000](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8757191/Are-additives-food-making-ill.html) different synthetic or natural compounds. 
This is because there's only sufficient incentives to research patentable molecules.

**2. Lack of Incentive to Discover Every Application of Off-Patent Treatments**

Most of the known diseases (approximately 95%) are classified as rare diseases. Currently, a pharmaceutical company must predict particular conditions to treat before running a clinical trial. If a drug is effective for other diseases after the patent expires, there isn't a financial incentive to get it approved for the other diseases.

**3. No Long-Term Outcome Data**

It's not financially feasible to collect a participant's data for years or decades. Thus, we don't know if the 
long-term effects of a drug are worse than the initial benefits.

**4. Negative Results Aren't Published**

Pharmaceutical companies tend to only report “positive” results. That leads to other companies wasting money repeating research on the same dead ends.

**5. Trials Exclude a Vast Majority of The Population**

One investigation found that only [14.5%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14628985) of patients with major depressive disorder fulfilled eligibility requirements for enrollment in an antidepressant trial. Furthermore, most patient sample sizes are very small and sometimes include only 20 people.

**6. We Only Know 0.000000002% of What is Left to be Researched**

The more research studies we read, the more we realize we don’t know. Nearly every study ends with the phrase "more research is needed".

If you multiply the [166 billion](https://www.nature.com/articles/549445a) molecules with drug-like properties by the [10,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/17/are-there-really-10000-diseases-and-500-cures/) known diseases, that's 1,162,000,000,000,000 combinations. So far we've studied [21,000 compounds](https://www.centerwatch.com/articles/12702-new-mit-study-puts-clinical-research-success-rate-at-14-percent). That means we only know 0.000000002% of the effects left to be discovered.

### Why Digital Health Innovation Has Failed

#### Duplication of Effort

![chart](assets/charts/data-and-apps.PNG)

Despite this growth, we've seen increased costs and disease burden and decreased life expectancy.

![cost and death](assets/cost/health-care-costs-and-life-expectancy.png)

The reason is awful **incentives**. There are more than [350,000](https://www.emarketer.com/content/over-350k-digital-health-apps-flooding-market-here-s-how-apps-stand) health apps and each costs an average of [$425,000](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mobile-health-app-development-costs-425000-average-likely-continuing-rise) to develop. Most have significant overlap in functionality, which represents a cost of [$157,500,000,000](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mobile-health-app-development-costs-425000-average-likely-continuing-rise) on duplication of effort.

![](assets/open-source/closed-source-horizontal-stagnation.PNG)

Isolated streams of health data can only tell us about the past. For example, dashboards filled with descriptive statistics such as our daily steps or sleep.

![](assets/open-source/thousands-of-descriptive-statistic-dashboards.PNG)

If this data and innovation efforts were combined, this could increase the rate of progress by 350,000 times.

![](assets/open-source/benefits-of-open-source-collaboration.PNG)

The obstacle has been the free-rider problem. Software developers that open source their code, give their closed-source competitors an unfair advantage, increasing their likelihood of bankruptcy.

**How to Overcome the Free-Rider Problem**

1. **Government Grants** - Currently, governments spend billions funding closed-source propriety health software. The Public Money, Public Code initiative, requires governments to recognize software as a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\_good\_\(economics\)) that is open source. This would lead to a massive influx in grant funding for open-source digital health projects.
2. **Open-Source Royalty Compensation** - By encoding contributions to the project with NFTs, we can provide ongoing royalty payments to open-source contributors.
3. **Licensing** - Although the project core framework will be open-source for any non-commercial purpose. However, we will utilize a [Fair-code](https://faircode.io) or [Fair Source](https://fair.io/?a) licensing model to generate revenue when utilized by for-profit entities. Licensing fees will be negotiated such that a fraction of the profits generated by the licensee's use of the project.
4. **Managed Software-as-a-Service** - Digital health companies can save months of development time and tens of thousands of dollars by using our platform instead of reinventing the wheel. A usage-based subscription platform for health application developers would start at $0.50/end-user per month.
5. **For-Profit Plugins** - WordPress, the most widely used web framework in the world, is open-source.  Businesses 
   earn revenue by creating for-profit plugins.  They contribute to improvements of the open-source core WordPress platform because these improvements benefit their business directly.

## 🏭 Platform

A global open-source platform and plugin framework will enable the transformation of data into clinical discoveries.

#### Functional Scope

The functional scope of the platform includes:

* aggregation
* managing
* processing
* storage

of health data from different sources.

#### Primary goal

Create a basic foundational technology layer suitable for any digital health application providing better interoperability, portability, availability, analysis, security of the data.

#### Use Cases

* EHR Systems for healthcare providers
* User-centered dashboards for personal health management
* Data sharing with doctors, health coaches, or family members
* Decentralized clinical trial platforms (e.g. BYOD wearable)
* Patient recruitment services for clinical trials
* Citizen science platforms
* Health data marketplaces
* Open health databases for research
* Algorithm and scores development (e.g. in-silico trials)
* Niche health applications with specific requirements or custom integrations

![framework diagram](assets/diagrams/layered-platform-architecture-diagram.png)

The platform consists of two primary components:

* **Core Open-Source Platform** - The core platform is open-source and includes only universally necessary features. This primarily consists of user authentication, data owner access controls, data storage, data validation, and an API for storage and retrieval.
* **Plugin Framework** - Plugins will provide additional functionality like data import from specific sources, data mapping to various formats, data analysis, data visualization, notifications. These may be free or monetized by their creator.

![framework diagram](plugins/plugin-marketplace.png)

### Core Components

**Data Ingestion and Access API**

The Unified Health application programming interface (API) includes an OpenAPI specification for receiving and sharing data with the core database. Software development kits (SDKs) will enable developers to implement easy automatic data access and sharing options in their applications.

**Data Mapping and Validation**

Data from files or API requests can be mapped from many different proprietary formats 
into a standard schema.

**Data Ownership**

Data should be owned by the individual who generated it. It should remain under their control throughout the entire data life-cycle from generation to deletion.

**Data Compensation**

Value stream management allows the exchange of data for tokens. 

### Plugin Framework

3rd party plugins can interact with the core and provide additional functionality. They may be free or monetized by their creator. These include:

* Data Import Plugins
* Data Visualization Plugins
* Machine Learning Plugins
* Electronic Health Record System Plugins
* Clinical Trial Management Plugins

![Branded Plugins](plugins/plugin-marketplace.png)

**Data Analysis Plugins**

Data Analysis Plugins will apply statistical and machine learning methods to the ocean of high-frequency longitudinal individual and population-level data. The resulting value will include:

* Personalized Effectiveness Quantification - Determination of the precise effectiveness of treatments for specific individuals
* Root Cause Analyses - Revelation of hidden factors and root causes of diseases
* Precision Medicine - Determination of the personalized optimal values or dosages based on biomarkers, phenotype, and demographics
* Combinatorial Medicine - Discover relationships between variables or combinations of interventions
* Optimal Daily Values - Determination of the personalized optimal dosages of nutrients or medications
* Cost-Benefit Analysis of interventions by weighing clinical benefit against costs in terms of side effects and financial impact

**Example Data Presentation Plugins**

* [Outcome Labels](plugins/outcome-labels-plugin/outcome-labels-plugin.md)
* [Predictor Search Engines](plugins/predictor-search-engine-plugin/predictor-search-engine-plugin.md)
* [Root Cause Analysis Reports](plugins/root-cause-analysis-reports-plugin/1398-root-cause-analysis.html)
* [Observational Studies](plugins/observational-studies-plugin/observational-studies-plugin.md)
* [Real-Time Decision Support Notifications](plugins/optomitron-real-time-decision-support-plugin/optomitron-real-time-notifications-plugin.md)

## ❤ Incentivization

How we use the DAO structure and NFT IP royalties reward data sharing and open-source collaboration.

### Incentive Alignment

This illustrates the flow of value between different stakeholders. As opposed to traditional zero-sum games, CureDAO provides a way for each self-interested party can derive more value from participation than they have to put into it.

![Value flow chain](<assets/business/value-flow-chain (3).svg>)

#### 1. Patients

Incentives for Patients to share their de-identified data will include:

1. Actionable ways to prevent and mitigate chronic illnesses.
2. The ability to license and earn a share of income for the use of their data for research and development by pharmaceutical companies and other businesses. NFTs will be linked to the user's cryptographic wallet address. Using a smart contract, the user will receive an ongoing royalty share of the profits for any product developed using their data for research and development.

#### 2. Businesses Housing Data Silos

Businesses housing data silos include health insurers, pharmacies, grocery delivery services, digital health apps, hospitals, etc. These will be incentivized to allow individuals to easily share their data via a well-documented OAuth2 API by:

1. A share of income for using their data for research and development.
2. An on-site instance of the OAuth2 server to retrieve required data from their on-premise databases.
3. Reduction in their employee healthcare costs (one of their most significant expenses)

#### 4. Incentives for Digital Health Businesses

1. Reduced costs of software development.
2. Massive free marketing exposure through company branded plugins in the Plugin Marketplace.
3. Revenue derived from their plugins in the Plugin Marketplace.

#### 5.Incentives for Disease Advocacy Non-Profit Organizations

Disease advocacy non-profits will be incentivized to promote observational studies through the anonymous donation data by their members by:

1. Furtherance of their mission to reduce the incidence of chronic illnesses.
2. Member engagement more productive than the traditional charity walk.

#### 6. Incentives for Government Health Agencies

1. A reduction in healthcare costs due to the discovery of new ways to prevent and mitigate chronic illnesses.
2. Furtherance of their stated reason for existence to protect and promote the general welfare.
3. Their duty to protect the rights of individuals' data. To fulfill this, they must require businesses in possession of it to give them the ability to access and share their data via a well-documented OAuth2 API
4. Cost-savings from international cost-sharing by using global open-source software.
6. Epidemiological discoveries on the effectiveness from differing public health regulations between nations.

#### 7. Incentives for Contributors to the Development of the Platform

1. Gitcoin Bounties for specific tasks
2. Encoding git commits with NFTs entitling the developer to ongoing royalties in proportion to their contributions.

## 🏛 Organization

CureDAO is a laboratory consisting of many experiments.

It’s a global laboratory where the 7 billion human “natural experiments” revealing the effects of various factors on human health and happiness are conducted.

It’s an experiment to determine if a new model for clinical research using real-world data can more effectively reduce the global burden of chronic illness.

It’s an experiment to see if a new economic model called Collaborationism can reward the creation of open-source “public goods” and overcome the failures of Capitalism and Communism.

It’s an experiment to determine if a direct democracy can produce better results than traditional hierarchical command and control organizations.

Given the unprecedented nature of such a project, each working group will be constantly experimenting with new ways to execute this mission. We recognize the importance of using real-world evidence in the mission of improving human health. Execution within the working groups should take the same data-driven approach to execute their area of the overall mission.

Accordingly, the organization is composed of three primary components

1. Citizen Scientists - DAO data donors or token holders with voting rights
2. DAO Laboratories - Working groups consisting of a Lab Manager who helps Lab Technicians carry out the duties of their Laboratory in accordance with the will of the Citizen Scientists.
3. External Service Providers - Individuals or entities outside the DAO deemed necessary to carry out the will of the Citizen Scientists.

#### Citizen Scientists

As an open and permissionless organization, anyone has the right to earn their Citizenship through the contribution of labor or resources. In exchange, the Citizen Scientist will receive CureDAO tokens granting full governance rights over the actions of DAO Lab Staff.

## Tokenomics

The CureDAO governance token is used to incentivize data sharing and open-source collaboration.  Tokens are obtained by contributing work, data, IP, or funds to CureDAO.

Tokens grant CureDAO [Citizen Scientists](constitution/5-organization.md) the right to decide how the DAO's resources are distributed.

### Token Genesis

The goal of CureDAO is for every human on earth to share the natural experiments that define their existence. The world’s population is projected to peak at 9.4 billion around 2070. To enable everyone to become a [Citizen Scientist](constitution/5-organization.md), upon genesis, 9.4 billion CureDAO tokens will be created.

The genesis distribution event will make 10% of CureDAO’s total token supply available to interested participants using a fair and open smart contract auction.

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

Since CureDAO’s genesis operates via a public auction, the community decides the initial token price. We estimate a minimum of $5,000,000 will be required to support the first iteration of the platform.

## 💰 Revenue

CureDAO generates revenue streams to compensate IP and data contributors and sustain and grow the project. The biotech and pharmaceutical industries are two of the fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. economy.

![sector-growth](assets/business/sector-growth-rates.png)

These factors all point to a massive potential for the revenue necessary to sustain this project. The primary sources of revenue include:

1. Sale of high-frequency longitudinal de-identified data to
   1. pharma for drug discovery
   2. research institutions for funded studies
2. Grants from governments modernizing their programs to take advantage of real-world data
3. Digital health companies wishing to accelerate product development using existing white-label software or hosted software-as-a-service (SaaS) options

#### Hosted Software as a Service (SaaS)

Digital health companies can save months of development time and tens of thousands of dollars by using our platform instead of reinventing the wheel. A usage-based subscription platform for health application developers would start at $0.50/end-user per month.

#### Sponsored Apps

This technology can also be used to dramatically drive down the costs of pharmaceutical post-marketing research. Sponsor apps using the platform can be provided to hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies who wish to improve patient outcomes and potentially gather patient-authorized anonymized patient data.

#### Data Licensing

Electronic health records (EHRs) can be used to support randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30718353/) found that the per-patient cost in EHR-supported trials varied from [$44 to $2000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30718353/). Using NFTs we can link donated data to the patient so that they may receive ongoing royalty payments for the use of their data once new interventions reach the market.

#### Software Licensing

Although the project core framework will be open-source for any non-commercial purpose. However, we will utilize a [Fair-code](https://faircode.io) or [Fair Source](https://fair.io/?a) licensing model to generate revenue when utilized by for-profit entities. Licensing fees will be negotiated such that a fraction of the profits generated by the licensee's use of the project.

## 📔 Legal Framework

A decentralized autonomous organization, or a “DAO,” is an “organization” encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not by a central corporate entity. In order to facilitate the entering of contracts, CureDAO will utilize an unincorporated nonprofit association (UNA) as a ‘wrapper’.

## 😷 Privacy

To protect privacy, CureDAO will use deidentification and obfuscated but equivalent data synthetically derived from actual patient data.

![de-identification](assets/privacy/deidentification.png)

### De-identification Methods

Data de-identification is the process of eliminating Personally Identifiable Data (PII) from any document or other media, including an individual’s Protected Health Information (PHI). The HIPAA Safe Harbor Method is a precise standard for the de-identification of personal health information when disclosed for secondary purposes.

### Data De-identification Tools

#### 1. ARX Data Anonymization Tool

[ARX](https://arx.deidentifier.org) is an open-source tool that anonymizes sensitive personal information. It supports a range of privacy and risk models, techniques for data transformation, and techniques to analyze the utility of output data.

#### 2. deid software package

The [deid software package](https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/deid/) includes code and dictionaries that automatically locate and remove PHI in free text from medical records. 

#### 3. Synthetic Patient Generation

[Synthea](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/) is an open-source, synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Our mission is to provide high-quality, synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering every aspect of healthcare. The resulting data is free from cost, privacy, and security restrictions, enabling research with Health IT data that is otherwise legally or practically unavailable.
